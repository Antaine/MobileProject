I created a plane and basic horizontal movement with the player always moving forward.  
Need to change movement so it supports lanes and the player does not fall off.  
  
Update movement to support lanes and move a fixed amount. Need to add jumping, gravity and a camera follow mechanic.  
  
Added a basic Jump and gravity.
Camera now folloes the player.  

Used blender to create a notebook asset.
Created Tiles to replace the plane with objects from office supplies as obstacles.  
Need to generate tiles so the track doesn't run out.  

Tiles Randomly generate infinitely.
Collisions, Death screen and Menus need to be implemented.  

Main menu with play & quit functions working.  
Options menu implemented with no functionality
